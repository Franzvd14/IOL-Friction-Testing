# IOL-Friction-Testing
Project Scope: Create a friction testing system that can quanitatively measure the durability and lubricity of the polymer coating. Due to the complex geometry of the IOL (Intraocular Lens), precise testing will have to be utilized. Client informed a strong need for lubricity with minimal particulates exasterabted from the surface to prevent contaimination from entering patient's eye. With this in mind, the need for the coating to be durable is essential.


Created an Intraocular lens cartridge friction tester to generate quantitative friction data and measure the performance of the polymer hydrophilic coating.
